README for Dijkstra.md

<hr\>

I don't know why, but if I use priority_queue (of library <queue>), I get TLE for no reason at the algorithm judge site.
It works properly, but it only gets error on judgement site.
So I removed priority queue uses, even if it makes me to degenerate the performance of the algorithm. (O(vlgv) -> O(V^2))
